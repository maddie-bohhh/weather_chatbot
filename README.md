Assignment #1: Parallel function calling chatbot

Instructions
Create a function calling chatbot script that supports parallel function calling. Have at least 3 functions listed in your tool calls and try to call them all in one prompt. 

Extra credit if you make the second API call for a natural language response using the data returned from the function call.

Please submit your code file (either .py or .ipynb) with some comments explaining your process.
